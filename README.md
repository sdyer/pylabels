pylabels
========

**Latest release:** 1.2.1

pylabels is a Python library for creating PDFs to print sheets of labels. It
uses the [ReportLab PDF toolkit][1] to produce the PDF, and works under both
Python 2 and Python 3.

Basically, the user creates a set of specifications of the label sizes etc,
writes a callback function which does the actual drawing, and gives these two
items to a Sheet object. Items are then added to the sheet using the
add_label() method (or add_labels() to add all items from an iterable).

The callback function is called once for each item, being given a ReportLab
Drawing object representing the label, its width and height, and the item to
draw on the label. Any of the standard ReportLab drawing methods can be used,
with pylabels automatically adding a clipping path around each label to prevent
it interfering with other labels.

Once all the items have been added, the labels can be saved as a PDF, or a
preview of a page can be saved as an image.

* [Partial pages](demos/partial_page.py) - how to produce partial pages (i.e.,
  pages with some of the labels previously used).
* [Repeated](demos/repeated.py) - how to use the count parameter to add
  multiple copies of the same label.
* [Background colours](demos/background_colours.py) - examples of solid,
  striped and hatched backgrounds of different colours on each label.

  names in the names.txt file. Includes the use of two custom fonts, font size
  selection, and centred text.
* [Image preview](demos/preview.py) - generates image previews of two of the
  pages from the nametags demo.
